1.1 What is Light Curve Toolkit?:
Light Curve Toolkit (LCToolkit) is an application for light curve inversion and the implementation of synthetic photometry for light curve prediction. In the case of inversion, the software is designed to estimate the shape and orientation pole of the object under study. By applying the inversion method, a three-dimensional model of the object is calculated. With this model, the light scattering characteristics. the pole and state of rotation the synthetic light curves are constructed, thus enabling their prediction within a wavelength range for a given date. This document is a user guide that will help you install the application and understand how it works.
